<h1>Competition Entry - Third Place (ML competetion)</h1>
<p>This repository contains Python scripts for tasks completed during a competition, resulting in a third-place finish.</p>

<h2>Scripts:</h2>

<h3>q1.py:</h3> 
<p>Converts lists of numbers to integers and vice versa, performing addition and multiplication on the converted integers.</p>

<h3>q3.py:</h3> 
<p>Manages student data (enrollment number, name, etc.) with functionalities for:</p>
<p>Generating a DataFrame template.</p>
<p>Taking user input for student information.</p>
<p>Saving data to a JSON file.</p>
<p>Extracting data from a JSON file and saving it to a CSV file (optional database integration commented out).</p>

<h3>q4.py:</h3> 
<p>Analyzes a dataset ("Ch3.ClevelandData.xlsx") using pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries. It performs the following tasks:</p>
<p>Reads the data from an Excel file.</p>
<p>Creates a boxplot (commented out in your provided code).</p>
<p>Cleans the data by handling missing values and non-numeric values.</p>
<p>Creates a heatmap to visualize correlations between features.</p>
<p>Generates a scatter matrix to explore relationships between variables (might require adjustments for Jupyter Notebook execution).</p>

<h3>Note:</h3>
<p>The database integration functionality in q3.py is commented out and requires additional configuration for your specific database.</p>
<p>The boxplot creation in q4.py might need adjustments based on how you intend to use it outside of a Jupyter Notebook environment.</p>
